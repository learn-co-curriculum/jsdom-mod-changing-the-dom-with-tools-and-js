# Changing The DOM With Tools and JavaScript

## Problem Statement

We've read that updating the DOM will update the browser's rendered page. Let's
_experience_ this now. We're going to change the DOM in two ways. First, we'll
use Chrome's Developer Tools ("DevTools") and our mouse to remove an element
from the DOM. Then we'll use the DevTools' JavaScript console to run JavaScript
that _does the same thing_.

## Objectives

1. Demonstrate viewing the DOM through Chrome DevTools
2. Select an element with Chrome DevTools
3. Delete an element with Chrome DevTools and the Keyboard / Mouse
4. Demonstrate that the source is not changed when the DOM is
5. Demonstrate opening the DevTools' JavaScript console
5. Select an element with JavaScript
6. Delete an element with JavaScript
7. Demonstrate that the source is not changed when the DOM is

## Demonstrate Viewing the DOM Through Chrome DevTools

![opening-console](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/opening-console.gif)

From this web page, look at the Chrome menubar at the top of the page. Click
on "View", then select "Developer", then "Developer Tools". This will open the
Google Developer Tools. Click on the "Elements" tab. Here we have the DOM
representation of the HTML source the browser loaded.

## Select an Element With Chrome DevTools

Mouse through the "Elements" panel 

You will see what looks like HTML.  There are head tags, body tags, divs, etc.

Now from inside the developer console, click on the element that says `header`,

## Delete an Element With Chrome DevTools and the Keyboard / Mouse

Press the delete button on your keyboard. The element will vanish from the
browser's rendered page.

## Demonstrate That the Source is Not Changed When the DOM is

View the page source. Right click (or two fingers click on the mac) on the
lesson page in the browser and select "View Page Source." You will see the that
the HTML is just as it always was, with a header tag and lots of other elements
inside.

The changes in the DOM do not affect the HTML file on the server. When you
think about it, that seems silly. If that were true then anyone with DevTools
could be mucking around with your carefully-written HTML.

The HTML, which lives on the server, **is unchanged**.

Refresh the page and reload the DOM _from the source_. The `header` should come
back.

## Demonstrate opening the DevTools' JavaScript console

We can do the _exact same_ work we did by selecting elements and deleting them
with delete key in the DevTools, with JavaScript. In DevTools, click the
**Console** tab.

At the bottom you will see a cursor. There, type the word `document` and press
"Enter." You'll get a `#document` returned. If you click the disclosure
triangle, you'll see that it's the exact HTML that you would find in the
**Elements** tab. Since `document` is an _object_ which means that it has
_properties_ and _methods_ we can imagine that by calling _methods_ on it, it
can _return_ DOM elements. Let's find or select an element by speaking
JavaScript with our friend, the DOM.

## Select an Element With JavaScript

In the **Console** type:

```javascript
  document.querySelector('header')
```

This will return something like this: `<header class="site-
header">...</header>`. Go ahead and click on that disclosure triangle to see
more. This is the DOM Node, a JavaScript _object_. This means that it, in turn,
can have methods called on it! Let's save our header to a _variable_.

```javascript
  var headerObj = document.querySelector('header')
```

## Delete an Element With JavaScript

Now type:

```javascript
  headerObj.remove()
```

The header is gone! 

If you refresh the page to get the `header` back, you could also try for some
slightly advanced JavaScript:

```javascript
  document.querySelector('header').remove()
```

This is called _method chaining_. Since the call of `querySelector()` to the
document _object_ "returned" a header object which supported a method called
`remove()`, we could use dot-notation to "chain" the calls.

## Demonstrate That the Source is Not Changed When the DOM is

Follow the same process we followed earlier to verify that the source has not
changed. Like before, to restore it, simply refresh the page i.e. reload the
DOM.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, believe it or not this is a huge learning moment. By our
definition of DOM programming, DOM programming is using JavaScript to:

1. **Ask the DOM to find an HTML element or elements in the rendered page**
2. **Remove the selected element(s)** or add a new element next to the selected element
3. Adjust a property of the selected element(s)

In this lesson you just did all that bold stuff! Learning to duplicate what you
can do in DevTools with JavaScript **is** DOM Programming, and you just did it!
The subsequent lessons are going enrich your understanding and give you better
_methods_ for selecting elements and changing them, but you've leapt the chasm
of understanding. High fives are in order.

As a summary:

* HTML is a markup language used to display content in a browser. When we
  change the appearance of a web page, with JavaScript or the Developer
  console, we are really changing is the Document Object Model, which directly
  determines the appearance displayed in the browser.
* We can view and manipulate the Document Object Model by opening our developer
  tools, but when we do so the HTML is not changed.
* We can also view our Document Object Model by opening the console and typing
  in the word `document`.
* We can select a specific piece of the DOM by using JavaScript, such as
  `document.querySelector('header')`, and we can also use JavaScript to alter
  our DOM with `document.querySelector('header').remove()`. We will cover more
  DOM manipulation methods in later lessons.
